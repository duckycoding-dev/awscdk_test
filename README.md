# awscdk_test
In this repo I'm testing and learning the AWS CDK, paired with LocalStack to develop and run code that will be deployed on AWS
The following content of the readme is what was automatically generated by running `cdk init sample-app --language=typescript` (which also created the whole project example structure)

## Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`AwscdkTestStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

### Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template


## What I've modified
Added `"versionReporting": false` to `cdk.json` to opt out of reporting cdk usage metadata
